Based only on the startup ideas that my clients have wanted to discuss with me lately, I'd say that Generative AI is having a bit of a moment.  As a long-time practitioner in the ML space, it's hard not to be amazed by how suddenly AI passed the Turing test.  But the more I dig into real use cases, the more concerned I've become about the negative side effects that broad adoption of Generative AI may bring.   Two concepts, Jevons Paradox and "Bike Shedding", help explain what I'm worried about.

[Jevons Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox) is an economics principle describing how, as technological improvements increase the efficiency with which a resource is used, the overall consumption of that resource can actually increase rather than decrease. A commonly cited example is that widening a highway can actually make traffic worse.  This counterintuitive outcome occurs because the increase in efficiency often leads to a reduction in the effective cost of using the resource, which can then increase its demand.

"Bike-shedding" is a popular term for [Parkinson's Law of Triviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality): the all-too-human tendency to focus on the tasks that make us feel least anxious, with the result that we put disproportionate energy into trivial issues.  In his 1957 book, Parkinson illustrated this concept with an example of a committee tasked with approving plans for a nuclear power plant. Instead of focusing on the complex and significant aspects of the power plant, the committee spent a disproportionate amount of time discussing relatively minor issues, like the design of a bike shed.

What does this have to do with Generative AI?  Here are three things that terrify me:

1. **It won't save us time on writing, it will just mean we have to write a lot more**: It's drastically reducing the cost to produce mountains of seemingly competent prose, but not the effort required for a human to read, understand, and evaluate it.  Jevons Paradox suggests that, rather than saving us time on our writing tasks, we'll simply find ourselves expected to produce a lot more writing overall.  Norms will shift such that, even if you prefer to do your thinking the old-fashioned way, there will be growing pressure to keep pace with the folks churning out AI pseudo-thinking.
2. **We'll need to read even more, and it will be harder to trust what we read**: The existence of a document with good formatting and grammar used to be prima facie evidence that one or more humans spent time thinking about the issues addressed in the document.  So much of our management and regulatory oversight practices rely on this fact - reviewing a document is supposed to take less time than producing it, allowing a relatively small number of managers to verify that important issues are being addressed thoughtfully.  Now, they'll find themselves in an arms race with teams leveraging AI.  They'll produce more and more pages of stuff, and the effort required to discern if the humans who produced the document actually know what they're talking about will increase dramatically.  The temptation for reviewers to start using AI to summarize all this AI-generated material will be strong.  Do you we really want to live in a world where you pay OpenAI to expand your bullet points into 5000 words of prose, then I pay OpenAI to condense them back down to a bullet list?
3. **It will add more trivial time-sucks to our lives**:  The temptation to bike-shedding is closely related to Jevons Paradox: the less it costs us to resolve a problem, the more psychological pressure we feel to do so. Google drastically reduced the cost of satisfying your curiosity when a question pops into your mind.  If you're old enough to remember life before Google, would you say you spend more or less time today looking up the answers to questions?  And what percentage of the time you devote to Google are you just scratching an itch rather than focusing on your real priorities?  Similarly with stuff, it's never been easier and cheaper to buy a specialized gadget to resolve any household problem, but as we're clicking "1-day shipping buy now!" we're generally forgetting about the time we will spend cleaning, organizing, configuring, repairing, and disposing of all those "solutions".  Unless we get better at resisting such temptations, AI assistants won't just cut down how long it takes us to complete trivial tasks, they will encourage us to add to the number of them we take on.

Now, I'm not an AI luddite, and these problems aren't new.   I expect Generative AI will eventually be at least as transformative as personal computing, mobile computing, and web personalization have been.  In many ways, AI is simply accelerating trends that these technologies began, for good and for ill.

The wonder and excitement that accompanies the beginning off a new phase of the machine intelligence revolution should prompt us to reflect on the skills we need to cultivate to make sure that technology serves us, and not the other way around.  More than ever, we need the mindfulness to choose and  remain focused on meaningful priorities, not letting technology set them by enticing us down the path of least resistance.  And we need to strengthen and update our critical evaluation skills: as AI gets rapidly better at putting the sheen of professionalism on careless work, we need to strengthen our ability to discern the trustworthiness and relevance of information on the fundamentals and not the formatting.

Easier isn't always better. Any complex system needs a balance of friction and lubrication to function well, and thought work is no different.  Let's make sure that, in the race to remove friction from our lives, we're clearing space to put our energy into things that matter.
