## About me

My name is Alex Hasha.  Iâ€™m an experienced Data Science leader with thirteen years of
professional experience developing models, building data-driven products, and managing
highly-skilled teams of Data Scientists.  Check out my [resume](/documents/alex_hasha_resume.pdf)
for the details!

I can offer your organization:

* **Full-lifecycle, multi-disciplinary perspective**: I have worked on every stage of the
  lifecycle of analytic products including R&D, prototyping, implementation, deployment,
  monitoring, governance, and retirement. This enables me to solve data problems holistically
  and collaboratively, navigating both the human and technical sides of delivering results to
  market.
* **A focus on analytical integrity**:  Analytical errors are much more common
  than decision makers would like to believe, and an analyst under time pressure can make
  mistakes that are invisible in the short run but significantly degrade their ROI in the long run.
  As a Model Risk Officer at Capital One, I mastered a variety of strategies and tactics to consciously
  manage this kind of technical debt and strike an intentional balance between quality and
  speed to market. These are based on a foundation of reproducibility and transparency,
  emphasizing documentation and software engineering best practices such as version control,
  automated testing, and CICD to ensure work can be handed-off and evidence of
  trustworthiness is always readily available to all stakeholders.
* **Team Building, Coaching, and Mentoring**: I was part of the team that developed the first hiring
  process for Data Scientists at Capital One, have launched teams at two startups, and coached over a hundred Data
  Scientists either as their manager or Model Risk Officer. I take pride in giving
  individualized attention to members of my team, giving feedback both on technical
  choices and business alignment to help them grow and achieve their goals.
