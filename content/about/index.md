I am a data leader with a passion for solving hard, real-world problems at the nexus of mathematics, data, software, people, and process. My goal is to accelerate climate change solutions using my expertise in building and managing data-driven products. If you are are working on a product that drives renewable energy deployment or electrification, I want to help you be wildly successful. Let's [work together](/consulting/)!

## The outcomes matter more to me than the job title

To achieve the results I care about, I've taken on a wide variety of roles and figured out how to be successful.  In recent years, I've been a:

- **Hands-on ML Engineer**: Enabling my client to [build and deploy better models](https://medium.com/mission-lane-tech-blog/automate-model-development-part-1-ed22b1760ca9) more efficiently, transparently, and reproducibly using a range of open-source technologies
- **Data Science team leader**: Hired and led the data science team for the carbon accounting engine at [Persefoni](https://www.persefoni.com)
- **AI Governance Leader**: I was a trusted partner for executives seeking business alignment and regulatory compliance for white space AI initiatives from chatbots to cybersecurity.  I helped them balance autonomy and accountability for their data science teams through independent model validation and risk management.
- **Data Science Product Owner**: I refined and prioritized the product roadmap for Capital One's enterprise ML platforms, balancing the needs of data scientists, engineers, and business leaders to deliver strategic value.
