## About Me

My name is Alex Hasha.  Iâ€™m an experienced Data Science leader with thirteen years of 
professional experience developing models, building data-driven products, and managing 
highly-skilled teams of Data Scientists.  Check out my [resume](/documents/Alex_Hasha_resume.pdf) 
for the details!

I can offer your organization:

* **Full-lifecycle, multi-disciplinary perspective**: I have worked on every stage of the 
  lifecycle of analytic products including R&D, prototyping, implementation, deployment, 
  monitoring, governance, and retirement. This enables me to solve data problems holistically 
  and collaboratively, navigating both the human and technical sides of delivering results to 
  market.
* **A focus on analytical integrity**:  Analytical errors are much more common 
  than decision makers would like to believe, and an analyst under time pressure can make 
  mistakes that are invisible in the short run but significantly degrade their ROI in the long run.
  As a Model Risk Officer at Capital One, I mastered a variety of strategies and tactics to consciously 
  manage this kind of technical debt and strike an intentional balance between quality and 
  speed to market. These are based on a foundation of reproducibility and transparency, 
  emphasizing documentation and software engineering best practices such as version control, 
  automated testing, and CICD to ensure work can be handed-off and evidence of 
  trustworthiness is always readily available to all stakeholders.
* **Team Building, Coaching, and Mentoring**: I was part of the team that developed the first hiring 
  process for Data Scientists at Capital One, have launched teams at two startups, and coached over a hundred Data 
  Scientists either as their manager or Model Risk Officer. I take pride in giving 
  individualized attention to members of my team, giving feedback both on technical 
  choices and business alignment to help them grow and achieve their goals.

## About You

Your organization has an exciting opportunity in the realm of data, machine learning, or artificial 
intelligence, or is just wondering how to capitalize on the revolution in AI that is happening all 
around us.  You know you would benefit from experienced Data Science leadership, but you're
not ready just yet to invest in permanent staff to tackle the problem.  You want a trustworthy 
advisor to help you evaluate the opportunity, prove out your idea, or hire the right team for the job. 
Perhaps you are considering an investment in an existing data team or product, and you want an 
independent perspective to help you make up your mind.  


## Services

* **Prototyping and proof of concept development**: building a prototype is an important first step 
  for testing the viability of a data product.  It clarifies the technical challenges and potential costs
  of bringing a fully functional product to market. 
* **Data modeling and data quality evaluation**: Data is the life-blood of any analytics or AI product.  I
  can help you prove out the value of your data by building automation to restructure it for analytical use cases and
  identify and manage quality issues.
* **Independent model validation and data product due-diligence**: Sometimes you just need a second opinion on a
  data or AI product.  I have years of experience digging into the weeds to test the performance and reliability
  claims that Data Science teams make about their products. 
* **Develop and execute Data Scientist hiring process**: I can help you identify the skill and experience profiles you 
  need on your Data team to achieve your business goals, develop an interview process, and interview candidates.    
* **Coach existing analytics teams**: I can help your existing team level-up their software engineering skillset and
  develop processes that let them scale while maintaining transparency and reliability.
