## About You

Your organization has an exciting opportunity in the realm of data, machine learning, or artificial 
intelligence, or is just wondering how to capitalize on the revolution in AI that is happening all 
around us.  You know you would benefit from experienced Data Science leadership, and you want a trustworthy 
advisor to help you evaluate the opportunity, prove out your idea, or hire the right team for the job. 
Perhaps you are considering an investment in an existing data team or product, and you want an 
independent perspective to help you evaluate the opportunity.

## Services

If this sounds like you, I may be able to help with...

* **Prototyping and proof of concept development**: building a prototype is an important first step 
  for testing the viability of a data product.  It clarifies the technical challenges and potential costs
  of bringing a fully functional product to market. 
* **Data modeling and data quality evaluation**: Data is the life-blood of any analytics or AI product.  I
  can help you prove out the value of your data by building automation to restructure it for analytical use cases and
  identify and manage quality issues.
* **Independent validation and data product due-diligence**: Sometimes you just need a second opinion on a
  data or AI product.  I have years of experience digging into the weeds to test the performance and reliability
  claims that Data Science teams make about their products. 
* **Develop and execute a Data Scientist hiring process**: I can help you identify the skill and experience profiles you 
  need on your Data team to achieve your business goals, develop an interview process, and interview candidates.    
* **Coach existing analytics teams**: I can help your existing team level-up their software engineering skillset and
  develop processes that let them scale while maintaining transparency and reliability.
