I help companies working on climate change solutions improve their return on investment from data.  I can help:

- **data science teams** to modernize, automate, and standardize their development processes and achieve better results more efficiently.
- **business leaders** to align data science initiatives with business goals, giving their data teams autonomy to do great work while holding them accountable to results

With a focus on delivering [analytical integrity](/analytical_integrity/) through [automation strategies](https://medium.com/mission-lane-tech-blog/automate-model-development-part-1-ed22b1760ca9), I have a [track record](documents/alex_hasha_resume.pdf) of delivering strategic value and have consistently advanced the technical maturity and business alignment of the teams I've worked with.  This opens new opportunities for them, and also reduces the long-term maintenance burden of their analytical assets.

### Ways to engage

1. **Request an initial consultation**: Fill out my [intake form](https://forms.gle/ocDywDpj3HAy87Pc8) to schedule a free 30-minute consultation.  We will discuss your team's opportunities and challenges and explore how I may be able to help.

2. **Opportunity Discovery and Strategic Projects**:  If we see a good fit, I will embed with your existing data science team on a monthly retainer model. In the first 30 days, I will onboard and familiarize myself with how your team works by completing the type of work assignments you'd give to a newly hired individual contributor.  After the onboarding period, I will provide an assessment of your team's risks and opportunities and a refined 30-60-90 day proposal of project goals.  At this point, we can make an informed, mutual decision about whether to move forward.

3. **Advisory consultations**: While I'm only taking on new projects related to climate change solutions, I'm available for ongoing advisory consultations on a broader variety of topics where I can offer expertise.

### Why choose freelance?

Adding permanent headcount [can be a risky way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month) to accelerate your team's progress, especially in today's challenging funding environment.  Early-career data scientists have a high tolerance for complexity and often deliver results that have high ongoing maintenance costs.  Working with an experienced Data Scientist on a flexible contract basis can lay a solid foundation for your team's future success without a long-term commitment.

Over 14 years as a Data Science leader, I've solved challenging data problems in diverse domains. I've been successful in a wide range of roles: as a people leader, a product owner, an executive risk advisor, and a hands-on-keyboard builder. My breadth of experience enables me to solve data problems holistically and collaboratively, navigating both the human and technical sides of delivering results to market.  Critically, I bring others along so that the impact of my work outlasts me.
